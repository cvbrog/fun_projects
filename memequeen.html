    <h3>I'm wishing you the merriest Christmas of all. May the following assorted memes bring you as much joy as doing the crossword with you brings me; I love hearing about the art and people and places that light you up. Cheers to sweet potato casseroles, the Smithsonian, creature comforts, daughters of the moon, celtic women bands, and YOU!</h3>
